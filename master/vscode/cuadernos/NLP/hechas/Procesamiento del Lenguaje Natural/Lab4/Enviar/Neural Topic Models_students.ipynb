We set the language to ``english`` since our NSF documents are in English, but we could also generate a multilingual model by setting ``language=multilingual``.\n","\n","Other parameters that we can configure are:\n","\n","| **Parameter** | **Description** |\n","|---|---|\n","| top_n_words | Number of words per topic to extract. It is recomendable to keep it between 10 and 20. |\n","| n_gram_range | It refers to the CountVectorizer's `n_gram_range` parameter used when creating the topic representation |\n","| min_topic_size | Minimum size a topic can have. The lower this value the more topics are created. It is advised to play<br>around with this value depending on the dataset's size. The default is $10$. |\n","| nr_topics | After training the topic model, the number of topics that will be reduced to. |\n","| low_memory | Sets UMAP's `low_memory` to True to make sure that less memory is used in computation. |\n","| calculate_probabilities | When set to True the probabilities of each topic to each document are calculated. It is turned off by default. |\n","\n","From the former, we will be setting ``calculate_probabilities=True``. This means that the second parameter returned after fitting the topic model will consist of the probabilities of all topics across all documents instead of only the assigned topic. Note though, that this slows down computation and may increase memory usage, so it is recommended its disablement when working with big corpora.\n","\n","Once we have instantiated the model, we need to fit it. We can approach this same as we normally do with the Skicit-Learn function, ``fit``, ``transform``, and ``fit_transform``. As the documents to fit, we will be using the **raw corpus** in the format of a **list of documents, each document represented by a string.**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"jlKQ59oAVacJ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":549,"referenced_widgets":["d546d41b892042d9ac53038d1874df2d","725495967bb443faac86dd1e2ac82fe2","56a71130ef084a4d8cbb67504729fd08","0df9e81ff8dc41c19d5ef7842ced43ec","314037d81edc46abbe6a6920947bd6cb","1e373b09eed74ba8846724bd174e4324","512fea81c788429b870620bf4aff883c","669809aefd624d529b5cc4679a019fb2","9a04edeac83540e4b9062af2eac11626","3e3638c4f54e4dfcb0c4b19dd158fd3b","400491bc630a4c5aacd2f319b44467fa","1a8968bcce0f4c3ca665ff5d7f640e8f","284b6b56d1964112b4f1bcea30497152","c14547ab141b45c397811b7cc2376262","ba0f82916f744f2384f02a10f1696396","8304632e1aba4020ae94af7c3703818e","2ac3d5b81a0f42a3977b93e4bb2942f1","2aae62f6f6c94848b8d3bd1e1c93220b","619b00e5232a4ff2a2c8a86c6985dd9b","8fcebbab15694d3e925743e319bb8efd","4c8254a28b4e455480e579c478dbe5f5","0745ffc3eec44228888dd99a27dcbdd3","96afc61c2a8541959916e3cbf5ffced4","487d14a10c0f41e59933b1b49e9ab793","4ea53fe797c14e95a111372500bc688f","c8385a6eb17b4dd88da92fbf2ee88487","f88caf79e18b4de5aefd13287d67a76a","d8d1ee54d7bd48849fd465af952de35c","6484e450cf534ae7bf56e6e3cf6c3274","6f7a4344849d4307ac228e321fbda2c1","652b0e310cb440f1b8649c8b75225c98","06d8347d936346c6b5cfac082ff53cfd","5c48fbacdf45481e8bb2c525daa1d055","f143cb116494453b90b416d8eb7db14b","47bfd1953ca24df2afe1de73d2a3e0e7","2d7ceff4229b45e1b11faa9ed49a7cc9","eceec61f673b401cae0e5d935f319f9d","38bcecd689b24a4aaae8230dac752acf","50c6a3435caf4189b79a57240db86b29","70198144750746b9af63b3abe2eea4e1","79d549e77a6d45f2aaa15f6c00d5706e","cf56799e6f1d48009a144df3bf2d9dab","7033c3af61b2459881b907d50a9e1590","0af6c2a2a0254399969b2ee7a58dca91","fbf308e8ee7b4887979f87e90b546696","5bd27594aad9432ea9000b9c51abc5ab","dd07802aa25d440d91522539037675a1","8e515b2463b147608cd2b5995930aff3","b10006f6da324b4d9fdc43474ec0a14c","ed34a66d3e4740c4a318bb875383677c","4b0d05258cb743ccb6394298631a39b4","65171f8ef5734f6197b6159cc65fccda","c76f8bac1f1c4491921965241ff1c03e","dca9f8f5d9dc4732837ff0a939cb9abf","ae2580a2b89b4647a6cfe2af404e03a0","11386ad0e03a469d860b048a05bb6b3d","9e3b299db0854f4bb6453ae0b9b6d46b","1fab1c53fd5c4489bcba892c37576cfc","766c4dd6bd4643cd85b89c9a237cd038","573227adc0c94b869eb8d65c071a16f0","4d770a4daa154107977f1272d48f05bb","f4d19cdf7f7948e5b0d416150d6cbe5c","32bc5e98e16649d7a47665672cfc0c3d","35c30301396a4c0484e24838c0f4bc8a","703f4094cd864d43a200ee22ec696dcf","f7fc56890fd24d6395b1f96ce01f19d2","0882ebd8da38430daec4d82af256231d","c0f8c5dafd864ff0b7e7419d1ec81534","ad4ddf52f2da481ea41b7ad29ecd759e","64174d15885840fab3129c64105187a2","88ced05d213445348f961d30cf70c9b6","8561971e302b48b9afa5f95898db89cd","47a6fff63581419eba4ec27244f24461","d3818b6a56b04650b7ee22d90c9eb51d","5bde5ca70f13430bb62a159ac037b5b7","de0d6a9ea9454bf1acbecdad0e5d1f3c","880f3ca6056741d5a2e65733b9e1eedf","2c37fd49caa948989e7e62090dee2777","0604f11aa7b340d8977faf40c9c7c35f","bfccb574e86044a8a8bdf9768fde85da","5a1188b7e7234ed9b4c174ca0e784247","bb4ebbb9f59e417aa7d88fb82f856c49","c36d1e58a5934c72b976004919255459","2c1c85e41b6e40cf839f04ac31ee0234","2649c2dbee644271a025e61f28a5ff60","e49ec7ed2b0d4d868fbf798aae033fa5","8a388399b48b4f228f84b31224f42fe2","8be5d2c337fe4bbaa656bc3ca09059c8","39df6a0c2c214ab8a7b1acc73a833fc7","49dea221ff1b4d93b42e60059aee774a","90449d6e658b4d7aa33f14c2015235f4","f086e88cd7704362b4db0a5cadaf0c6a","9795c5d4ecba4829849c65cc28882d2f","b307b9bfb5b34547a754a6491a3f0635","7b39561113994f5f8d61c947a9402260","f64b144538d74f7cb37f20921fb99227","2d22b412678a45b3941cc7141882141e","86c36eb956e74868952d569ad0883d3a","1635d0667f0442ffb7476352c9b99df8","f7c10085e9bc404190723d82dd423bda","3334fe1073c540b99ff8d3b7ecab3f09","ff65a3ff30804a2db67e9fff7a1f2224","e860dc57793f4df398500099a5163ef3","73bd8b34e4d4474b81657e327e6af293","119ccf57731b4074bf8d81b41a36e98b","e761676790414c9fb178dc0d393718b0","353b33a9846b4cbcb8bcef49c575de71","ff99734c5d3c40158e9706e2fcb24fb3","b1bfdbfe4d3d4e7d85f5691032bf7ea7","371a2c5a420242a9935dc4c1381000f3","58fd02c01f7143f98c3c4bb797158b08","8a3bd191459b4de6b83bd0d9d7ad6a44","185652b9733040a7b57f0eff7f1c693e","11e4c40166a842f2bdb527cba00f5921","f315d42730684926af2087598da71397","f953e6b7ec31463c8fba4f4ceb5424e0","3a0b5b17c32f4f4893c9a1124a8185c3","85ac1a02737744b2b725ddedfdadf948","9b6bfbd3f33e4cc4af1e93b7336c8e54","761d2e0189ad4fa49425a16bb333dcb0","2029fdca093d4a42af2bbcad630e3825","660cfa91e89447c6a868cc6286b56801","9b585aff926c4b8f958b641493329c49","08e6208a519a43f481175affa46722a6","95e573d449324e99a073af8dc1b8b76c","96363f075338494daaa49fc5e8c09da5","04718a88c168495c95206b3173e4097c","3ba23ce220b44822a7585c2c82c40363","bac90042f66c4308a839cc8695797f64","cfa5f21c8b014473be99c9976c6af6ae","48171e12c95e469b9cd8a11927e147c9","e5ddc69855c7470a8ff32ece99887142","1d6a9ce288234f0a91eb2effd8cfab93","6face0ed8408483c88f4c1d1bde32d8f","bbfc9ac191044fc7a1ebb169c2ea9f37","edc570a083cf43a480e2e6e082659af5","14aa3d4e9985430e9833b219f4b35782","fa5e49c86ede4efa8ad096278df8ad21","

parameters that we can fine-tune to improve the performance of our topic model. Rather than exposing all parameters in BERTopic, what we do when we want to make a fine tuning of this algorithm is to instantiate a UMAP model and then pass it to BERTopic. The most important parameters to configure are:\n","\n","* ``n_neighbors``: It controls how UMAP balances local vs global structure in the data. Low values will force UMAP to concentrate on very local structures, while large values will push UMAP to look at larger neighborhoods of each point, losing fine detail structure. The default value is $15$.\n","* ``n_components``:  Dimensionality of the reduced dimension space the data will be embedded into. Since UMAP scales well in the embedding dimension we can use it for more than just visualizations in 2- or 3-dimensions. The default is $2$.\n","* ``min_dist``: It controls how tightly UMAP is allowed to pack points together by providing the minimum distance apart that points are allowed to be in the low dimensional representation. Low values result in clumpier embeddings (good for clustering or finer topological structure), while larger values will prevent UMAP from packing points together and will focus on the preservation of the broad topological structure instead. The default value is $0.1$. \n","\n","* ``metric``: It controls how distance is computed in the ambient space of the input data. By default, UMAP supports a wide variety of metrics. The default is euclidean.\n","\n","When fine-tuning your UMAP model, you may find useful the following documentation: \n","* [How to use UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html)\n","* [Basic UMAP parameters](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters.html#n-components)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"IUIypaOWFuy2","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1674078842944,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1578306,"user":{"displayName":"José Lorente López","userId":"17635609222309178675"}},"outputId":"d490f732-c17d-47a4-be32-6aa6b23ccc5e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["2023-01-18 21:53:32,030 -
