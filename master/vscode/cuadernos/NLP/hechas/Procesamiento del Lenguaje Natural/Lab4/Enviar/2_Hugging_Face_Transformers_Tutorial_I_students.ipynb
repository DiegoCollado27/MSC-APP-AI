Split the input into tokens (words, subwords, or symbols): ``tokenize()``\n","2. Map each token into an integer: ``convert_tokens_to_ids()``\n","3. Add additional inputs that may be useful to the model:\n","  *   **Padding.** Batching allows the model to work when you feed it multiple sentences, but this can lead to problems when we attempt to batch together two (or more) sentences that are of different lengths. Since we are working with tensors, we need them to be of rectangular shape. We solve this issue by padding our sentences so they all have the same length by adding a special word called the **padding token** to the sentences with fewer values.\n","A **tokenizer's padding token ID** can be found in ``tokenizer.pad_token_id``.\n","  *   **Attention masks.** They are tensors with the exact same shape as the input IDs tensor, filled with ``0s`` and ``1s``: ``1s`` indicate the corresponding tokens should **be attended to**, and ``0s`` indicate the corresponding tokens should **not be attended to** (i.e., they should be ignored by the attention layers of the model), e.g., the padding tokens should be ignored.\n","  *  **Special tokens.** When encoding an input string sequence, the tokenizer will add some special tokens. For the case of token classification, for example, it adds additional tokens ``[CLS]`` at the beginning and ``[SEP]`` at the end. This is because the model was pretrained with those, so to get the same results for inference we need to add them as well. Note that some models don’t add special words, or add different ones; models may also add these special words only at the beginning, or only at the end. In any case, the tokenizer knows which ones are expected and will deal with this for you. We can access these tokens as ``tokenizer.cls_token_id`` and ``tokenizer.sep_token_id``, respectively.\n","\n","One last thing that we need to take into account when performing tokenization is the **limit to the lengths of the sequences we can pass the models** that are imposed by the Transformer model in use. Most models handle sequences of up to 512 or 1024 tokens and will crash when asked to process longer sequences. There are two solutions to this problem:\n","\n","* Use a model with a longer supported sequence length.\n","* Truncate the sequences. We can truncate our sequences by specifying the parameter ``truncation=True``. Additionally, we can specify the maximum length after which sentences will be truncated with the ``max_length`` parameter.\n","\n","**Steps 1 and 2** of the Tokenization process above described are

In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.
