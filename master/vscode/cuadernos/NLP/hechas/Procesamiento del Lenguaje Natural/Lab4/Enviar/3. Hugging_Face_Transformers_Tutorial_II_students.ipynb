David was the son of Emperor Heraclius and his wife and niece Empress Martina. He was born after the emperor and empress had visited Jerusalem and his given name reflects a deliberate attempt to link the imperial family with the Biblical David. The David Plates, which depict the life of King David, may likewise have been created for the young prince or to commemorate his birth. David was given the senior court title caesar in 638, in a ceremony during which he received the kamelaukion cap previously worn by his older brother Heraclonas.\n","After the death of Emperor Heraclius in February 641, when David was 10 years old, a power struggle ensued between different branches of the imperial family. As part of a compromise, David was raised to be co-emperor, ruling with his brother Heraclonas and their nephew Constans II. The Byzantine state faced serious challenges while Tiberius was co-emperor, with the ongoing Muslim conquest of Egypt and continuing religious strife over monothelitism and other Christological doctrines. All three emperors were children and the Empress Dowager Martina acted as regent. Martina was deeply unpopular due to her incestuous relationship with Heraclius, her unconventional habits, and her ambition. Her regime was deposed in a rebellion, probably by January 642. She and her sons were exiled to Rhodes and, in an early example of Byzantine political mutilation, Martina's tongue was cut out and the noses of her sons were cut off. There is no further historical record of Tiberius, and some historians speculate that he and his family lived out the rest of their lives peacefully.\n"]}],"source":["import wikipedia\n","\n","context1 = wikipedia.summary(\"David (son of Heraclius)\",auto_suggest=False).strip()\n","print(context1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Le pasamos al modelo la pregunta junto al contexto y este nos responderá:"],"metadata":{"id":"U1tm5fT8jwmk"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ceB6AmCnwMPZ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1673737510184,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1364,"user":{"displayName":"José Lorente López","userId":"17635609222309178675"}},"outputId":"43526d92-ce7c-421c-e1ad-dc92f640bc57"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[38;5;12m\u001b[1mQ: What was the regnal name of David?\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[38;5;1mA: Tiberius\u001b[0m\n"]}],"source":["question1 = \"What was the regnal name of David?\"\n","r = question_answerer(question=question1, context=context1)\n","print(fore.LIGHT_BLUE + style.BOLD + f'Q: {question1}' + style.RESET)\n","print(fore.RED + \"A: \" + r['answer'] + style.RESET)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Kn6jBWOLFbW0"},"source":["We can also ask multiple questions at once by providing the pipeline with them  within a list:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Le podemos varias multiples preguntas a la vez:"],"metadata":{"id":"b7F92_gjj6AE"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Q4eS-dSrFanL","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":139},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1673737517124,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":6739,"user":{"displayName":"José Lorente López","userId":"17635609222309178675"}},"outputId":"f369d352-8dff-48b0-e71f-60c7fcd34d69"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Disabling tokenizer parallelism, we're using DataLoader multithreading already\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[38;5;12m\u001b[1mQ: Who was the father of David?\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[38;5;1mA: Emperor Heraclius\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[38;5;12m\u001b[1mQ: What does David's name reflect?\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[38;5;1mA: a deliberate attempt to link the imperial family with the Biblical David\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[38;5;12m\u001b[1mQ: When did Emperor Heraclius die?\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[38;5;1mA: February 641\u001b[0m\n"]}],"source":["questions = [\"Who was the father of David?\",\n","             \"What does David's name reflect?\",\n","             \"When did Emperor Heraclius die?\"]\n","\n","results = question_answerer(question=questions, context=context1)\n","\n","for q, r in zip(questions, results):\n","  print(fore.LIGHT_BLUE + style.BOLD + f'Q: {q}' + style.RESET)\n","  print(fore.RED + \"A: \" + r['answer'] + style.RESET)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o6hYzlr_Kq2s"},"source":["Although the models used in the Hugging Face pipelines generally give outstanding results, sometimes you will have particular examples where they don't perform so well.

During this time, modern comic books were first published and rapidly increased in popularity. The superhero archetype was created and many well-known characters were introduced, including Superman, Batman, Robin, Captain Marvel, Captain America, and Wonder Woman. Between 1939 and 1941 Detective Comics and its sister company, All-American Publications, introduced popular superheroes such as Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Doctor Fate, the Atom, Hawkman, Green Arrow and Aquaman. Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics, had million-selling titles featuring the Human Torch, the Sub-Mariner, and Captain America. Although DC and Timely characters are well remembered today, circulation figures suggest that the best-selling superhero title of the era was Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel with sales of about 1.4 million copies per issue. The comic was published biweekly at one point to capitalize on its popularity.Patriotic heroes donning red, white, and blue were particularly popular during the time of the second World War following the Shield's debut in 1940. Many heroes of this time period battled the Axis powers, with covers such as Captain America Comics #1 (cover-dated March 1941) showing the title character punching Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.As comic books grew in popularity, publishers began launching titles that expanded into a variety of genres. Dell Comics' non-superhero characters (particularly the licensed Walt Disney animated-character comics) outsold the superhero comics of the day. The publisher featured licensed movie and literary characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Roy Rogers and Tarzan. It was during this era that noted Donald Duck writer-artist Carl Barks rose to prominence. Additionally, MLJ's introduction of Archie Andrews in Pep Comics #22 (December 1941) gave rise to teen humor comics, with the Archie Andrews character remaining in print well into the 21st century.At the same time in Canada, American comic books were prohibited importation under the War Exchange Conservation Act which restricted the importation of non-essential goods. Canadian publishers responded to this lack of competition by producing titles of their own, informally called the Canadian Whites.

The unit arrived quickly, was well packaged and arrived intact (always a good sign). There are five wall mounts-- three on the top and two on the bottom. I wanted to mount it on the wall, so all I had to do was to remove the top two layers of plastic drawers, as well as the bottom corner drawers, place it when I wanted and mark it; I then used some of the new plastic screw in wall anchors (the 50 pound variety) and it easily mounted to the wall. Some have remarked that they wanted dividers for the drawers, and that they made those. Good idea. My application was that I needed something that I can see the contents at about eye level, so I wanted the fuller-sized drawers. I also like that these are the new plastic that doesn't get brittle and split like my older plastic drawers did. I like the all-plastic construction. It's heavy duty enough to hold metal parts, but being made of plastic it's not as heavy as a metal frame, so you can easily mount it to the wall and still load it up with heavy stuff, or light stuff. No problem there. For the money, you can't beat it.

To compute the ROUGE scores, we need to generate summaries. 🤗 Transformers makes this automatically for us through two dedicated classes ``Seq2SeqTrainingArguments`` and ``Seq2SeqTrainer``. Hence, instead of instantiating objects from the classes ``TrainingArguments`` and ``Trainer``, we will use the Seq2Seq-specific ones.\n","  * When using the ``Seq2SeqTrainingArguments`` class, we need to care of the following arguments:\n","      * ``predict_with_generate=True`` to generate summaries during evaluation so that we can compute ROUGE scores for each epoch. The Transformer's decoder performs inference by predicting tokens one by one, and this is implemented by the model’s ``generate()`` method. Setting ``predict_with_generate=True`` tells the Seq2SeqTrainer to use that method for evaluation.\n","      *   ``save_total_limit`` to limit the number of checkpoints saved during training. This is necessary since even the \"small\" version of T5 uses around a GB of hard drive space, and we can save a bit of room by limiting the number of copies we save.\n","  * The usage of the ``Seq2SeqTrainer`` class is equivalent to that of the ``Trainer`` class. \n","2. Since T5 is an **encoder-decoder Transformer model**, during decoding, we need to shift the labels to the right by one when preparing our batches. This is necessary to ensure that the decoder only sees the previous ground truth labels and not the current or future ones, which would be easy for the model to memorize. 🤗 Transformers provides a ``DataCollatorForSeq2Seq`` collator that will dynamically pad the inputs and the labels for us. The way we instantiate this collator is by providing the tokenizer and model.

This metric takes texts as inputs and targets and is designed to accept several acceptable targets (often multiple acceptable translations of the same sentence). So, the predictions should be a list of sentences (where sentences are strings), but the references should be a list of lists of sentences. This metric will return a dictionary, from which we are interested in the value associated with the key ``score``.\n","  * You can define the ``comput_metrics`` function based on the \"sacrebleu\" in a similar way as we did with summarization.

tokenized."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"gpuClass":"standard","kernelspec":{"display_name":"ids","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.6
